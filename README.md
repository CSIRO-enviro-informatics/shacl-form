# shacl-form
This repository contains a Python application that generates HTML + JS webforms from given [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) "shapes". The intention is to allow for the auto-generation of web UIs, given only a logical expression of the required data that the UI is to facilitate the input of.

It is assumed that:
* The SHACL Shapes file supplied will contain only one Node Shape
* All Property Shapes will be associated with that Node Shape
* The Node Shape will have a target class
